Masters-Projects
================

Some of the interesting projects that I worked on while doing my masters in CS.
Classified by subjects-
1. Computer Graphics (C++)
2. Operating Systems (C)

All these programs have scope for improvement. Although, I do not feel the need or use to make changes to these as I will not be using them anytime in future. Feel free to contact me in case of doubts or suggestions.
